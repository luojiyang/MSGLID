# MSGLID
Multi-view Statistical Graph Learning Intrusion Detection (MSGLID) is an effective and fined-grained learning model for practical in-vehicle network intrusion detection. With high-performance operation efficiency, MSGLID is well adapted to the vehicle environment and protects the security of the in-vehicle CAN bus.
You can see the details in our paper *Effective In-vehicle Intrusion Detection via Multi-view Statistical Graph Learning on CAN Messages*. (The link is on the way...)
